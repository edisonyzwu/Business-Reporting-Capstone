          While high mortgage rates and Trump tariffs continue to weigh on the US home construction
          industry, manufactured housing companies are thriving against the backdrop.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          Cavco Industries Inc., a Phoenix, Arizona-based manufactured home company, climbed 30% in
          the past 12 months, the biggest increase among all home builders, according to data
          compiled by Bloomberg.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          Rivals Bedford, Texas-based Legacy Housing Corp. and Troy, Michigan-based Champion Homes
          Inc. gained 18% and 8.7%, respectively, while the broader home construction sector fell
          14%, suggesting growing investor interest in factory-built homes as an alternative to
          traditional housing.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          Cavco says it is expanding production to meet rising demand. “If we had a dollar to spend,
          we probably would spend that dollar in growing our existing plant capacity,” Chief
          Financial Officer Allison K. Aden said during a Jan. 31 earnings call.
        </p>

        <div class="subhead">Housing Affordability Constraints</div>
        <p class="copy-width">
          The surge in manufactured housing comes as US housing affordability continues to hover
          near historically low levels. The National Association of Home Builders, based in
          Washington, DC, says the median price of a traditional single-family home climbs to
          $400,000. Nearly 60% of American households can’t afford a $300,000 home, according to
          Bloomberg data.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          The US economy shrank in early 2025, the first contraction since 2022, on a monumental
          pre-tariffs import surge and more moderate consumer spending. Many executives cited the
          collapse in consumer confidence and the potential for a more guarded approach to spending.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          Paul J. Romanowski, chief executive officer of D.R. Horton Inc., said during an April 17
          earnings call that the housing market has softened this year. The Arlington-based
          company’s shares have dropped 34% since a record high in September 2024.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          “This year’s spring selling season started slower than expected as potential homebuyers
          have been more cautious due to continued affordability constraints and declining consumer
          confidence,” Romanowski said.
        </p>

        <div class="subhead">Factory-Built Alternatives</div>
        <p class="copy-width">
          Manufactured homes have been seen as an alternative at lower prices. The average sales
          price of a new factory-built home was about $127,300 in 2023, less than a third of the
          cost of a site-built home, according to the US Census Bureau.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          “Our target market of homebuyers consists of households with total annual income below
          $75,000, which comprised 47% of total US households in 2023,” said Duncan Bates, chief
          executive officer of Texas-based Legacy Housing during a March 12 earnings call, “This
          group, nearly half of all households in the United States, has been severely impacted by
          increasing rental rates, higher prices for site-built homes, elevated mortgage rates, and
          stagnant wage growth.”
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          Factory-built homes are also gaining traction as disaster recovery solutions. Billionaire
          Joe Gebbia, co-founder of San Francisco, California-based Airbnb Inc. and board member of
          Austin, Texas-based Tesla Inc., is donating $15 million of pre-fabricated homes through
          his startup Samara to low-income residents whose properties burned in the Los Angeles
          wildfires. The two-bedroom, two-bath units can be built in as little as five months and
          installed within weeks.
        </p>

        <div class="subhead">History of Pre-fabricated Homes</div>
        <p class="copy-width">
          Prefabricated homes trace back to 1908, when Illinois-based Sears, Roebuck & Co., sold
          70,000 mail-order houses. Buyers received materials and could either build the homes or
          hire contractors.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          The industry peaked in 1972 with 600,000 units shipped, accounting for 60% of new
          single-family units, according to US Census data, even as mobile homes during that time
          faced structural and safety issues and lost value faster than site-built units.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          In 1974, Congress passed the Mobile Home Safety Standards Act, establishing federal rules
          and enforcement. The same year, a recession triggered by the energy crisis pushed the
          housing market into decline. Mobile home production dropped and never returned to peak
          levels.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          Manufactured homes made up 9% to 10% of new housing over the past decade, rising by 1
          percentage point in the past year, according to the Manufactured Housing Survey.
        </p>

        <div class="subhead">Shifting Policy</div>
        <p class="copy-width">
          Challenges persist. Zoning laws in many municipalities restrict where manufactured homes
          can be placed. Financing options remain limited. Buyers turn to personal property loans,
          which carry higher rates than traditional mortgages, because most manufactured homes sit
          on leased land and aren’t classified as real estate, making them ineligible for
          conventional home loans.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          Industry groups are lobbying for regulatory reforms, seeking changes to zoning rules and
          expanded access to standard mortgage financing to unlock demand.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          Federal and state policies are shifting. In September 2024, the US Department of Housing
          and Urban Development announced the most extensive revisions to the manufactured home
          construction and safety standards in more than 30 years. The changes, covering 90 new or
          amended standards, allow for the construction of multi-unit manufactured homes such as
          duplexes and triplexes for the first time.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          In California, state law requires cities and counties to permit federally certified
          manufactured homes on lots zoned for single-family residences under Government Code
          Section 65852.3. The law mandates that manufactured homes meet the same development
          standards as site-built homes.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          The implications are growing. With traditional homebuilders slowing output and
          affordability challenges persisting, manufactured housing offers a potential solution to
          the US housing shortage.
        </p>

        <div class="subhead">Market Expansion</div>
        <p class="copy-width">
          While manufactured housing remains a slice with 6% of US home stock, it is spread across
          states, with concentration in the rural areas of the South and East, according to Census
          Bureau data. Industry players see room for expansion as new housing policies and economic
          pressures reshape the housing landscape.
        </p>

        <p class="copy-width">
          “I think where affordability is the worst, that's where municipalities are challenging
          their thinking and trying to figure out how to open up to really a better option for
          housing and more close in and urban areas, which is factory-built housing,” said William
          C. Boor, chief executive officer of Cavco, “So, I feel good about the directional trend
          and it's always just been a question of how fast and when.”
